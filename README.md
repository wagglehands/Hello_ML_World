# Hello_ML_World
 We will be using Machine Learning to predict the values of a sine wave. This is the classic "hello_world" application for machine learning on microcontrollers of feeding an algorithm data and letting it learn to predict the outputs based on the inputs. In this case the neural network will be trying learn the function of Y = sin(x), by only having the data.
